Hi Siddhanth Venkateshwaran,

Good job with your simulations. A level of randomization could have been introduced with the no. of server nodes in your ring.

Your grade for HW3 is 16%.

Comments:
+3% for the usage of typed Behaviors model for Akka actors.
+3% for a documenting your implementation and execution steps.

Good work on your simulations. I was particularly impressed with your context watch implementation when it comes to
managing failure of nodes.

Your grade for the project is 20%.
